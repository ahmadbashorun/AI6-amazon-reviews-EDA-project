3,5,False,2011-05-03,A2UEO5XR3598GI,B0000530HU,Rich K,"HEY!! I am an Aqua Velva Man and absolutely love this stuff, been using it for over 50 years. This is a true after shave lotion classic. Not quite sure how many women that have been attracted to me because of Aqua Velva,  I do know for sure that it's just to many to count. Ha.  Not sure how long this has been around but the Williams Company ran a paper advertisement, taken from a 1949 magazine, which features Ralph Bellamy of Detective Story and Ezio Pinza of South Pacific for Aqua Velva After Shave Lotion. I'm sure you all remember Ralph Bellamy and Ezio Pinza from the 40's right.

There slogan was "" There is nothing like an AQUA VELVA MAN "" and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when I was a young man. It's just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.

The only negative about Aqua Velva is it does not last very long. Usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated. The more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have Ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.

At any rate this is a great classic after shave with a wonderful refreshing odor, give it a try you might just like it.

I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.

I've used this brush nearly every day for at least 5 years now and the only reason I can tell its not brand-new is because the words ""Elizabeth Arden"" have worn off. I've never ever had a single bristle fall out of the brush, even when I'm washing it. I also take good care of it and wash it every week with baby shampoo.

The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation. I find that this brush works really well with the Bare Minerals loose powder foundation, though I've gotten wonderful results using this brush with pressed powder as well.

We purchased this cape to use when my wife gives me and my son haircuts.

- Adjustable neck strap (works on me and my 7 year-old son)

- Repels water
- Appears to be well made

~CONS~
I would prefer a snap closure versus the velcro which tends to hold hair - a minor gripe though.

Super Orgasm by NARS is a glowing, dispersed mash of papaya and raspberry shade with a metallic cloud of shimmer with tiny bits of chunky glitter. That might sound scary but its so wonderfully fine that it looks radiant and as if it was coming from within. For everyday makeup I reach for this no matter what Im wearing or what makeup goes on, it just looks alive even before I have my coffee without looking over done.

 This shade is sultry and sun kissed with this Hollywood Photoshop filler thing going on, it simply looks delicious. I love the whole range and Im also a fan of the NARS Sin  and Orgasm blushes, but this is the best.

The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life.

Bath and Body Works quit selling this and the lotion that went with it and I have no idea why.  Everywhere I went perfect strangers would ask me what scent I was wearing!  I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.

On opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

One of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

The price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.

I'm noticing a lot of reviews mentioning the reviewer's significant other loving the smell and I'm thinking maybe it's a guy thing to love a simple clean smell on a woman (not bathed in perfume) because my husband loves the faint smell of this body wash after I take a shower.  Last thing I'll mention is how I love that this body wash does not dry out my skin.  I have very dry skin, and usually the combination of a hot shower and body wash leaves my skin red and itchy.

I first found it online by doing a search for things with pumpkin in it, and now I'm on my 4th bottle of this and I also recommend the body lotion and face creams, I am slowly becoming totally enamored with this brand and always look forward to trying more things.

This wash beats soap anytime in the shower; the orange gelee collapses on itself when poured and feels cool and refreshing especially in the morning. I love the scent, its very delicate, smell like soft fruit scented air, nothing aggressive and doesn't feel too organic and strange but fancy enough. There is ginko biloba and cucumber water, green tea, chamomile, orange and of course carrots, silky aloe, cleansing Dead Sea water and even spirulina extract, which I have drank before but never used in products. It feels very light and my skin always feels clean but light, never dry and uncomfortable. The bottle is also large and lasts a while, which is nice.

As I get older it becomes more important to me to use as little chemicals as possible, of course in today&iexcl;s world we are bombarded with them and its hard since they appear in everything but still, ever little thing counts. Parabens for example are used as preservatives and are generally considered safe because of low levels of toxicity, but lately I keep reading how traces are found in cancer lumps especially in women and simply knowing that a cosmetic doesn't have it makes me happy. And I love my cosmetics almost as much as books, the bathroom is always stacked : )

This shower gel by Solstis is really unique; it smells like no other cosmetic I have ever used. Sure many items will try and smell like an ocean, with the wet green blue artificial scent, yet they do not compare to this one.

This wash smells like the salty ocean water, sunscreen lotion, sun, sand and a slight layer of milky fruit. It's really radiant and silky on and has the most incredible fresh scent; it makes me feel as if I have entered a paradise island and Im watching the sunset settling in misty colored sweet clouds as waves crash at my feet as I have never used a product that smelled this unique. At first this will smell faint, but using this with scrubby gloves or those bath poofs will yield luxe foam and a burst of some peaceful mineral rich island.", 6.7 oz

I find their mango shaving soap and rhubarb shaving cream to be very close or even on par with Acqua di Parma, which for me is the best shaving cream in existence, not just in terms of performance but also the scent and packaging, I love the rhubarb after shave balm but this hibiscus shaving cream, I believe it has no equal and I've tried a number of high-end shower products. The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life. Taking the morning shower with this baby is the perfect way to start the day.",

Bath and Body Works quit selling this and the lotion that went with it and I have no idea why.  Everywhere I went perfect strangers would ask me what scent I was wearing!  I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

Buy it Again",

Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.

On opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

One of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

The price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.

Great job Pattern on a fantastic product, you have made a routine shower a much better experience.",

I would be lying if I said I wasn't also attracted to it because it's my favorite color, purple. Softsoap is also pretty reasonable, price wise, so I don't feel bad buying more than one bottle at a time.

This one, thankfully, leaves my skin nothing but silky smooth and smelling wonderful!

This wash beats soap anytime in the shower; the orange gelee collapses on itself when poured and feels cool and refreshing especially in the morning. I love the scent, its very delicate, smell like soft fruit scented air, nothing aggressive and doesn't feel too organic and strange but fancy enough. There is ginko biloba and cucumber water, green tea, chamomile, orange and of course carrots, silky aloe, cleansing Dead Sea water and even spirulina extract, which I have drank before but never used in products. It feels very light and my skin always feels clean but light, never dry and uncomfortable. The bottle is also large and lasts a while, which is nice.

As I get older it becomes more important to me to use as little chemicals as possible, of course in today&iexcl;s world we are bombarded with them and its hard since they appear in everything but still, ever little thing counts. Parabens for example are used as preservatives and are generally considered safe because of low levels of toxicity, but lately I keep reading how traces are found in cancer lumps especially in women and simply knowing that a cosmetic doesn't have it makes me happy.

Not quite sure how many women that have been attracted to me because of Aqua Velva,  I do know for sure that it's just to many to count. Ha.  Not sure how long this has been around but the Williams Company ran a paper advertisement, taken from a 1949 magazine, which features Ralph Bellamy of Detective Story and Ezio Pinza of South Pacific for Aqua Velva After Shave Lotion. I'm sure you all remember Ralph Bellamy and Ezio Pinza from the 40's right.

There slogan was "" There is nothing like an AQUA VELVA MAN "" and it seemed to work because this was a hot item when I was a young man. It's just amazing that this is still around when the vast majority of after shave lotions from that time period have disappeared over the years.

The only negative about Aqua Velva is it does not last very long. Usually in less than an hour the aroma has dissipated. The more expensive after shave lotions and perfumes have Ambergris in them which is quite expensive and comes from a sperm whale this enables the aroma to linger much longer.

At any rate this is a great classic after shave with a wonderful refreshing odor, give it a try you might just like it.

Other than that, I don't think it is that great. The orthodontist said the priority should be flossing and brushing, not the Waterpik. He said the Waterpik does not have enough pressure to remove plaque. This is really just for getting the big chunks of food before I brush and floss with Oral-B Superfloss.
Before I got braces, I occasionally used the Waterpik but I can't say it did much for me.
It has been a year and I have noticed a puddle of water around the Waterpik after I turn it off. I think the handle is now leaking.
After my braces come off I will probably throw the Waterpik away.

UPDATE: I was right. The handle does in fact leak. I could buy a replacement handle for $10 but I don't want to. Overall, the Waterpik lasted about a year, which is not acceptable for a $50 item.", Ultra

The hand held WP-450 model has a 2-year warranty, but I've never had the batteries last for two years. Some don't make it to 18 months. The one I bought a year ago now only lasts for about 4 or 5 sessions before the charge dies. I recharge them for over 24 yours when they get week, which is what Waterpik recommends. So I have two so I can use one while the other one charges. Got tired of all this and got this plug in model and I wish I had done this several years ago. Being tethered to the hose is not a problem at all, the hand unit is much lighter and more maneuverable than the battery model, lighter too. I use this on #7 setting on the dial and it is just about the same as my old 450 units with a fresh charge. The highest setting is really powerful! Control easy to use, uses the same tips as my old units. I floss first, lightly brush with a tooth brush, then use a Sonicare. After this routing my hygienist still found food under my gums during a routing cleaning! That is when I added the Waterpik to my routine and they never found food after that again. Amazing to see what flossing and brushing with a Sonicare leaves behind. I am 67 and my gums have receded, so I need the extra flushing power of a water flosser. Dental floss does not get down between the gum and base of the tooth. I recommend this for anyone who is either starting out with your first water flosser or using a rechargable unit that you don't want to replace every 18 months because the battery is failing. Extra tips store in the lid to the tank. Tank easy to remove for cleaning. Can even be washed in the dishwasher if you remove the rubber valve/plug unit.

Many years have past and I have shot through quite a few Waterpik models and this is the current one I own. It is a little more evolved than its predecessors, but it still performs in pretty much the same way it always has. You fill the reservoir with water, attach the head to the handle which has a control to turn the water stream on and off, and then turn the device on to produce a spray of water as you move the head around to remove debris from between your teeth and gums. I think of the Waterpik as a power washer for the teeth and gums because it forces out pressurized water to irrigate those areas.
This model has a varying speed control to increase the water pressure to whatever is comfortable and effective for the individual user. It also comes with six different tips. While I use the flossing tip, there are tips for brace wearers, people who have crowns,etc, a tongue cleaner, and a couple of other tips for specific functions.
Other than eliminating the need to floss, the Waterpik has been beneficial to me. My teeth are always clean, I don't have gum disease, plaque, dental decay, etc.

First, read the instructions.  Start off with low pressure as this little pump can shoot out quite an aquatic projectile!  Just make sure you have the nozzle turned AWAY from your eyes.  NEVER let this anywhere near your eyes.  Once you have regulated the flow to where you want it, you are ready to enter a whole new world of oral health!

This little Godsend also comes with a tongue cleaner.  After you give yourself a good oral cleansing, you and your dentist will have entered into a new phase of your oral health partnership.  This is EXCELLENT for your tongue, teeth and gums and does a very thorough job.

After looking at all the models, we choose this one. It holds a lot of water. It has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

I looked at the ones that were battery powered but I didn't think they would hold enough water and I couldn't see him refilling it to finish. This model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

There is a huge variety of tips but I don't think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

The tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

It is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.

It saves sooo much time and effort. Honestly, if I use this and then use regular floss string afterward, I never have anything come out on the string. I love this Waterpik! My teeth feel so clean after using it.

It is easy to use. You just fill the basin with water, pick your setting with the dial, and turn it on. It is a little messy - water run off - but it is worth it! I use it on the highest setting with no discomfort or pain at all. The different heads are all very useful and store right in the lid of the basin. It flips open and there is a compartmnt to keep them all. The coiled cord stays neatly in place in the holster when not in use.

I use a basin full of water, then refill with half water/half mouthwash and my mouth and teeth feel so clean and so smooth. It feels like I just left the dentist. It is also easy to clean from behind the teeth as well.

I went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn't cutting it.

I had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I'm still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn't strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.

I started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but I'm getting used to it by now. I put Listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.

My dentist went on vacation, and I had to cancel another appointment, so it happened that almost two months had elapsed since the last time I had seen him. In that time, I faithfully brushed with the Sonicare four times a day and used the Waterpik at least once (several tankfuls of water and Listerine worth.)

Regarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, I notice, is if I put my fingers on the seal when I'm refilling it. If I'm careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.

So when I returned for my check-up, the dentist was AMAZED. He wasn't sure what I had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! He had said initially I'd have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because I must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, I had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (I had also bought a dental mirror so I could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)

Hmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there WASN'T any? My dentist asked me if I had been eating because there was so little build up (I had to tear that out of him because I KNEW he didn't want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)

1277,3,True,2007-09-08,A3SMR4HRFJARSC,B000GLRREU,ChristineMM,"When I was a child our family bought the first WaterPik that came onto the market. The whole family used it for many years. The area where the water came out was small and the spray could be directed easily. It did not make a mess. It was fantastic for cleaning my teeth, which had braces.

Now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a WaterPik.

This thing is unbelievable. The spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. Even I, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. This is a mess. I am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.

Tip: Put the device in the mouth, then turn it on. Try to use it with your mouth closed or nearly closed and shut it off before you remove it from your mouth.

After reading other customer reviews, to prevent possible leakage, we take the unit apart and dump out the water after each usage.

Do your research regarding other models available as well as this one. The customer reviews here on Amazon are eye-opening.

I wish they made the WaterPik like the original ones that lasted for many years and were easier to manage.

Update: One child has been using this for 16 months and it is still functional.

Note on my star rating: For effectiveness for the job I'd rate it 5 = I Love It but for the mess I rate it a 1 = I Hate It which averages out to 3 star rating = It's okay.", Ultra

To get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.

I agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).

The water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.

Sound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  In fact, it is less noise than my shaver.

The auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. Again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there's the compact size trade-off again.

In actual performance - wow!  You will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! Wonderful feeling. There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! I've found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.

On the plus side, it provides the same benefits as other rinses and does it without the burning sensation I get from those with alcohol. Plus, the lack of alcohol helps me deal with chronic dry mouth issues (alcohol rinses and mouthwashes make dry mouth much worse).

But how a rinse tastes is important since you'll be tasting it for some time after use. This was overly sweet rather than ""fresh mint"" tasting like other rinses (such as ACT). The aftertaste remained sweet to the point where it was unpleasant.

I'm was concerned about the potential for tooth staining. I've not had any issues with that so far with this rinse, but it was a concern.

Amazingly, this actually tastes very good, whereas every non-alcoholic mouthwash I've ever had before (mostly in hotels) has been horrible.  The ironic thing is that it says they don't use alcohol so that you don't get that burn.

I'm a bit of a wimp when it comes to the mouthwash burn, so the strength of it is usually the first thing I notice when trying out a new mouthwash. My husband who seems immune to the strength of every mouthwash out there, seems fine with this Crest formula and has no problem washing with it. I haven't had any issues with this mouthwash turning my teeth colors or causing any kind of build, and neither has my mouthwash addicted husband. So it seems to work well. It leaves your breath smelling great and lasts quite a while. I like this wintergreen version a bit more than the mint, since I've always been a fan of the more refreshing taste of wintergreen.

One thing I do appreciate is that Crest did not use Yellow #5 food coloring to make this mouthwash, since most companies use that color to produce the green hue in their products (including Scope). Some people, myself included, have a sever food allergy to Yellow #5 and can't use or eat anything with that food coloring it it. For those with this condition, note that Crest has used Yellow #6 instead to create the mouthwashes green color. The Crest Pro-Heath mouth wash in the Invigorating Clean version, which is an even greener colored mouthwash, also doesn't use Yellow #5, and used #6.

1296,3,False,2013-04-06,A2OCDK0BOW6UCY,B000NKJIXM,Antigone Walsh,"I thought this rinse might be a more palatable alternative to Listerine Total Care.  But with average performance and a questionable active ingredient, it is unlikely that I will use this again.

The rinse comes in an easy to used bottle with a pleasing contour. I did not particuarly care for the wintergreen flavor, it was rather sweet, mint-like and artificial. But my major concern come from the potential side effects for the active ingredient, cetylpridinium chloride. While it has antiseptic, anesthetic and disinfectant properties it is used in bug poisons as well as dental preparations. While its use has been FDA approved, I think there are more natural, less toxic and equally effective ingredients available. Moreover this ingredient has been known to cause browning of the teeth as well as intefering with the sense of taste. The bottle label warns of the discoloration risk but claims that the staining is neither permanent nor harmful. It claims such stains may be removed by brushing or ""at your next dental visit"". If my teeth suddenly browned, I don't think I would want to wait for my next regularly scheduled dental visit. Dental visits don't rate high on my fun things to do list and I would rather not spend my discretionary income on removing tooth discoloration caused by a mouth wash.

So while the performance of this rinse was adequate, I will pass until they change the formulation.",

This enables him to get a smooth feeling on the skin without stripping and irritating it, and no creams and products are needed. The 3 rotating heads really adjust to the contour of the face and they snap open for easy clean up with water. I've seen him use it and it's a cinch, fast, easy and no mess!

Overall this is a great product, it works well and the face feels and looks good afterwards and it takes very little time to use. Better than shaving when it comes to comfort but my man still prefers the razor when he has to shave for work.

After using the razor for three weeks to get used to it, it is still a bit of a let down.  It does very well cutting the hair along the cheeks but doesn't to very well along the chin and neck and found myself going over these areas over and over again to get the desired shave even breaking out my conventional razor occationaly to get a few pesky hairs that just wouldn't cut.

There are plenty of pros about this razor.  The trimmer does a decent job evening out the sideburns.  The razor tells you how much time the battery has left so you should never run out of juice in the middle of shave and it is easy to charge either on the stand or in the carring case the razor comes with.  The razor is really easy to clean.  And there is little to no irritation after the shave aside from a couple minutes of numbness right after the shave, but it's nothing a splash of water won't cure.

But if you want a close shave, a conventional razor is better but when I don't have time to break out the shaving cream, this razor will definately be suffciant.",
1301,5,False,2007-12-11,A28N2AWOVO2PB,B000PKKAGO,Simon Cleveland,"I used to wonder what caused redness and skin irritation every time I shaved. When it started for me I tried switching to environmentally friendly shaving cream, then I changed my shaving blades, then I tried changing my aftershave, but nothing helped. Regardless of what I did the irritation always came back.

I think I finally found the answer after I started using the new Philips Norelco drive-shave system. First, let me sing a praise for its smooth design and ingenious way of reminding me when I need to clean the blades (a cool blue image of a water faucet appears on the handle immediately after each shave) and how many minutes of battery life remain (cool blue large numbers appear after every shave as a reminder). As far as I am concerned these are the two main things I need to know so that I can get the job done.  Next, let share with you how wonderful I feel after each shave. The benefits of dry shaving prevented my skin from being exposed to the sharp blades and water, which in my opinion are solely responsible for the irritation of my skin.

If I could recommend one minor improvement, it would be to make the system's blades sensitive enough to be able to remove even the smallest or toughest hairs on my neck. I find myself having to reapply some circulating effort around the same areas every time until I get all the hairs out of the way. Still, this is a small price to pay considering the fact that I am pain and embracement free after each shave. A great gift idea.",

I find their mango shaving soap and rhubarb shaving cream to be very close or even on par with Acqua di Parma, which for me is the best shaving cream in existence, not just in terms of performance but also the scent and packaging, I love the rhubarb after shave balm but this hibiscus shaving cream, I believe it has no equal and I've tried a number of high-end shower products. The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life. Taking the morning shower with this baby is the perfect way to start the day.", 8

Bath and Body Works quit selling this and the lotion that went with it and I have no idea why.  Everywhere I went perfect strangers would ask me what scent I was wearing!  I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

That said, I usually use their other line but since I'm not getting younger, I thought I'd try their more mature line. Strangely, it's LESS moisturizing than their younger line. I'm still using it but next order will be back to their younger line of skincare.

I think the essence in this package is better but the overnight cream and moisturizer in the other package is much better.

I do not use their eye cream, though. Gave it away as it's just too heavy for my purposes and increases milia.", 439

(Side Note: baby shampoo is significantly less expensive and works better than any ""makeup brush shampoo"")

The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation. I find that this brush works really well with the Bare Minerals loose powder foundation, though I've gotten wonderful results using this brush with pressed powder as well.

Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.

On opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

One of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

The price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.

Great job Pattern on a fantastic product, you have made a routine shower a much better experience.", 299

However, I saw this and couldn't pass it up. Black orchid and velvet? It sounded (and smelled) wonderful! I would be lying if I said I wasn't also attracted to it because it's my favorite color, purple. Softsoap is also pretty reasonable, price wise, so I don't feel bad buying more than one bottle at a time.

This one, thankfully, leaves my skin nothing but silky smooth and smelling wonderful!

(I have to believe ""truth in advertising"" laws are at work here, because my Sonicare doesn't produce results that are any better than any battery-operated toothbrush I've used.)  Then you get this item which is designed to sanitize said toothbrush.

How can you really tell if this thing ""sanitizes"" your toothbrush head?  Even if you tried to fake it by putting, say, spaghetti sauce on the toothbrush and then sanitizing it, that still doesn't prove anything.  It hums and then you take your brush head out.  But what are the benefits of sanitizing the brush head?  Again, I notice no difference in my mouth from how things were before I had this, compared to after using this.  So, it does nothing obvious, but if you're paranoid, you might want to get it just to believe you're chasing down every tiny bacterium.",

I have a Sonicare toothbrush so for me the head of the toothbrush fit inside without a problem.  If you have another model then there are adapters you can put on it so that you can clean any other toothbrush.  But since I don't use them, I can't comment on how well they work.

The cleaning itself is pretty easy.  Just put it in, make sure the brushes are pointed the right way, close the lid, and hit the power button.  Ten minutes later it is done and all those big, bad bacteria are dead... well, 99% of them anyways.

So, there you have it, it works and it is easy to make it work.  What more could you ask for?

As a note, I do want to comment on what another reviewer wrote.  Namely, that people have survived decades without a device like this.  And I'd have to agree.  That is why I mentioned in the title that this may be perfect for hypochondriacs while most people will shrug and wonder what the point is.  For me, it is more of an OCD where I like to be thorough on the things I do.  Therefore, when I give my brush a thorough cleaning (monthly or so) then I like to finish it off inside of this product.  It's all a mental game and if this product makes you feel better/safer then it is worth every penny.",

Well, no more. I have an automatic toothbrush and all I do now is put its head in this neat sanitizer and it kills all the bacteria and I can go on for another 20-30 days without having to worry about repeating this process. The product has UV bulb, which is what actually kills the bacteria. There is an extra brush head holder for different models of brush heads (Oral-B-FlexiSoft and FlossAction and most Sonicare models). I didn't have troubles putting the holder into the Sanitizer. The cleaning takes approximately 10 minutes and when complete it shuts itself off. It was prebuilt with a drip tray to get rid of excess water. This is a great gift for anyone in your family.

It is a handy place to store the brush heads in a sanitary manner (if you believe that the UV light kills the bacteria).

That said, for $50 plus S&H is a bit much for brush storage and cleaning.
The recharging stand has worked well enough for me in the past, and I've never had any issue with bacteria on my brush heads.  Rinse thoroughly after use and tap to get the water out, that should be enough in my opinion.  As the ""biologist"" stated in his review, this seems a bit like overkill.

This is a simple to use product that probably does what it says.

I do think this helped in terms of providing a close, fairly smooth shave. My legs were soft afterwards, though I did also use a body lotion.

Here are the ingredients since I didn't see them on the product page:

Water, Stearic Acid, Myristic Acid, Squalane, Glycerin, Potassium Hydroxide, Organic Coconut Oil, Glycol Distearate, Fragrance, Organic Jojoba Seed Oil, Organic Pomegranate Oil, Organic Green Tea Leaf Extract, Organic Shea Butter Fruit, Phenoxyethanol, Tetrahydroxypropyl Ethylenediamine, Ethylhexyl (Octyl) Palmitate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Tocopherol, Limonene.",

This helps reduce water waste and prolong Spongelle's useful life-span. About a month and a half after first use, I start adding some of my favorite body wash. And after three months I replace it with a new one.", 27

I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair, 1

I find their mango shaving soap and rhubarb shaving cream to be very close or even on par with Acqua di Parma, which for me is the best shaving cream in existence, not just in terms of performance but also the scent and packaging, I love the rhubarb after shave balm but this hibiscus shaving cream, I believe it has no equal and I've tried a number of high-end shower products. The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life.

Bath and Body Works quit selling this and the lotion that went with it and I have no idea why.  Everywhere I went perfect strangers would ask me what scent I was wearing!  I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

I'm always on the hunt for ""something like it.""
It reminds me of the 70's fragrance, ""Golden Autumn"", also not being made any more.
Today's scents hit my nose in the wrong way, they are either too ""piquant"" with heavy tones of freesia, or too much like bubble gum.
I spent the money and bought Channel No. 5 thinking, I'd just sort ""move up"", and while it smell great at first blush, it turns into just a baby powder smell on me. I can get baby powder for a lot less.

I've never ever had a single bristle fall out of the brush, even when I'm washing it. I also take good care of it and wash it every week with baby shampoo. (Side Note: baby shampoo is significantly less expensive and works better than any ""makeup brush shampoo"")

The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation. I find that this brush works really well with the Bare Minerals loose powder foundation, though I've gotten wonderful results using this brush with pressed powder as well.

Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.

On opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

One of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

The price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.

Great job Pattern on a fantastic product, you have made a routine shower a much better experience.", 299

However, I saw this and couldn't pass it up. Black orchid and velvet? It sounded (and smelled) wonderful! I would be lying if I said I wasn't also attracted to it because it's my favorite color, purple. Softsoap is also pretty reasonable, price wise, so I don't feel bad buying more than one bottle at a time.

This one, thankfully, leaves my skin nothing but silky smooth and smelling wonderful!

We purchased this cape to use when my wife gives me and my son haircuts.

~PROS~
- Adjustable neck strap (works on me and my 7 year-old son)
- Good size at 36"" x 54""
- Repels water
- Appears to be well made

~CONS~
I would prefer a snap closure versus the velcro which tends to hold hair - a minor gripe though.

Today's razors are so much better than years ago.

Even though this is a wet or dry shave razor it seemed to drag a bit when dry shaving. Maybe because of some slight perspiration I don't know, but it did not move smoothly over my skin. Than I thought of Williams Lectric Shave, something I have heard of for years but never tried.

The first thing I did when I got it home was smell it and was not impressed with the odor, in fact I thought it was extremely unpleasent. I figured I'll use it to shave, than wash it off and that will be the end of it. But NOooo I shaved than washed it off 1 time, 2 times than a third time and the smell did not disappear from my face or hands. Plus the odor lingered for hours. I don't know if it is just me but I think the smell is just awful And I would not buy it again just for that reason. I would check out the other brands on the market.

As for the actual purpose of this lotion, I was impressed it worked exceptionally well. The razor glided over my face without any kind of drag and evidently did what it was supposed to since I got an exceptionally close comfortable shave.

So 5 stars for the shave and 1 star for the Odor. I have plenty of after shave lotions that I really like and resent the fact that I am forced to use there odor if I want a good shave. Odorless for this product would be a definite plus. My 2 cats won't eat any treats I give them if I have this odor on my hands, at least I have 2 paw's up on my assessment of the odor. Ha!", 7 Ounce

I put my regular application of hand cream on, and worked it in, and then, prepping for sleep, I put a big glob on my hands and rubbed it all around, sort of like you do on the face with a mask or hair with deep conditioner.

I was really excited to try these moisturizing booties. Unfortunately, they did not love up to my expectations. First of all, I thought they would moisturize my feet just by wearing them as indicated in the name. They don't. You are supposed to put cream or lotion on your feet before putting them on. This means that the cream/lotion is moisturizing your feet, not the booties. I used to rub lotion on my feet and then wear socks to bed which does the same thing.

I wore these booties to bed and they immediately started annoying me. They have thick seams right at the toes and again at the heel. I couldn't stop rubbing the seams trying to make them more comfortable. Do they help hold in the heat and allow the lotion to really moisturize? Yes. So do socks. I have a pair of really soft, fluffy socks that have the same effect and are more comfortable.

Sadly, I cannot recommend these booties. I would suggest getting a really comfortable pair of socks and using them for the same thing. You can probably find them cheaper and they will work just as well.",

I have combination skin where I have an oily T-zone and dry cheeks. This cream is not greasy so it is OK for the oily skin and it is moisturizing so it also soothes the dry skin conditions on my face. I have not found this to be irritating like other Vitamin C creams and serums. In fact this seems to calm my skin significantly so it is not overly sensitive. If you want to look ten years younger, this is the cream to try. I find it helps with elasticity and skin resilience. I also notice I break out less and have overall clearer skin. I love this and hope it works for you too. Always test a bit on your wrist before applying.

It works even with razors that are kind of dull (which is good, because I forget to change my razor out as often as I should) -- I didn't cut myself at all.

Because this isn't a foaming product, you do have to use more than you would with some competing products.  I found it non-irritating, too.  (You can see the full ingredients list if you scroll down the main product page.)

This does have a strong smell.  I kind of like it, but I have heard from plenty of people who detest the scent.  It's an artificial blueberry sort of scent.  So if you have reactions to strong fragrances, you may want to stay away.",

Please note that while this does contain some plant oils and extracts, it also contains artificial fragrance.

When distributed from the container, it has an airy texture. However, it doesn't foam terribly well, so when you spread it out over the area to be shaved (I used it on my lower legs), it can be hard to see. (I could feel it, though, if I ran my finger over my legs.)

I do think this helped in terms of providing a close, fairly smooth shave. My legs were soft afterwards, though I did also use a body lotion.

I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair, 1

I find their mango shaving soap and rhubarb shaving cream to be very close or even on par with Acqua di Parma, which for me is the best shaving cream in existence, not just in terms of performance but also the scent and packaging, I love the rhubarb after shave balm but this hibiscus shaving cream, I believe it has no equal and I've tried a number of high-end shower products. The cream has a consistency that is hard to describe but is just right, foams easily, washes off easily, leaves the skin supple and soft and with a scent so delicious that I keep smelling myself for hours after the shower, it's just gorgeous beyond description. I also love the bamboo and rhubarb scents, respectively, they're just as good and some people might actually prefer one or the other to hibiscus, but for my taste hibiscus is sheer perfection when it comes to fragrance. By the way, I don't really know what hibiscus smells like, this definitely smells nothing like hibiscus tea, which was the only hibiscus scent I ever had a chance to try but it's a classy, elegant fragrance that just makes you appreciate life.

Bath and Body Works quit selling this and the lotion that went with it and I have no idea why.  Everywhere I went perfect strangers would ask me what scent I was wearing!  I told them this in the store, as if it did any good.  SO, for all you out here who love the vanilla scent, try this, also sold on Amazon:

Monoi Tiare Tahiti Coconut Oil Vanilla -- 4 fl oz
Sold by: Express Health
$11.26

It is made in Tahiti and has a real vanilla bean in the bottom of the bottle.  Because it has coconut oil in it, it solidifies at 68 degrees, but all you have to do is put it into your hand and it melts.  It smells SO GOOD!  It also has Tiare flower scent in it that the Bath & Body Works formula had as well as Vitamin E and actual vanilla bean fragrance from a real vanilla bean.  It is only 4 ounces, but a little goes a long way and is only $11.26.  This is a body lotion and it smells awesome and is the closest thing to the B&BW formula I could find with a reasonable price tag.

The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation.

I was recently traveling and ran out, used a different product to wash my hair, and was miserable until I could get back to this product.", 7

3986,5,True,2013-09-19,A3N81O636W6H9A,B0012Y0ZG2,Ben Freeman,"Having given up on bar soap and its innate ability to dry my skin out, I have been using shower gel for years.  Until recently, I've had no preference to any brand, as I felt they were all pretty similar.  After seeing some of the awards that Pattern Body Wash has received in various men's magazines I decided to try it for myself.

On opening the bottle, the fragrance was not overpowering or chemical-smelling, at all;  in fact, it was quite the opposite,  It has a great aroma with, not really a subtle scent, rather more subdued, and certainly not overwhelming.  In addition to nutmeg, I have also tried citrus, eucalyptus, cucumber, sage and black pepper, and all of them have been outstanding fragrances.  I was also impressed by the small amount of gel needed to clean the entire body.  Many of the other brands that I have tried seem to over-foam and usually leave a little residue that needs a secondary rinse to remove.  This is not the case with any of the Pattern products I have tried.  The body wash is silky, with just the right amount of lather, and it cleans exceptionally well.

One of the other areas, in which I compare body washes, is the dryness that ensues after toweling off after a shower.  Pattern is exceptional in this realm and leaves the skin smooth and soft, even in a very dry climate with little humidity.

The price point is certainly several dollars more than I would normally spend on a standard body wash, but in all truth, one bottle lasts longer than all of the other companies I have tried over the past 20 years.

Great job Pattern on a fantastic product, you have made a routine shower a much better experience.", 299

However, I saw this and couldn't pass it up. Black orchid and velvet? It sounded (and smelled) wonderful! I would be lying if I said I wasn't also attracted to it because it's my favorite color, purple. Softsoap is also pretty reasonable, price wise, so I don't feel bad buying more than one bottle at a time.

This one, thankfully, leaves my skin nothing but silky smooth and smelling wonderful!

I'll explain. You know, when you feel yourself hazy from an alcohol buzz, I was washed my face with it and when I opened my eyes, everything seemed brighter. THis stuff actually does revitalize.

We purchased this cape to use when my wife gives me and my son haircuts.

~PROS~
- Adjustable neck strap (works on me and my 7 year-old son)
- Good size at 36"" x 54""
- Repels water
- Appears to be well made

~CONS~
I would prefer a snap closure versus the velcro which tends to hold hair - a minor gripe though.

~CONCLUSION~
This cape has made cutting hair easier as it keeps cut hair off of clothes and contains a lot of hair so it can be dumped into the trash can and shaken out outside.", 174

Today's razors are so much better than years ago.

Even though this is a wet or dry shave razor it seemed to drag a bit when dry shaving. Maybe because of some slight perspiration I don't know, but it did not move smoothly over my skin. Than I thought of Williams Lectric Shave, something I have heard of for years but never tried.

The first thing I did when I got it home was smell it and was not impressed with the odor, in fact I thought it was extremely unpleasent. I figured I'll use it to shave, than wash it off and that will be the end of it. But NOooo I shaved than washed it off 1 time, 2 times than a third time and the smell did not disappear from my face or hands. Plus the odor lingered for hours. I don't know if it is just me but I think the smell is just awful And I would not buy it again just for that reason. I would check out the other brands on the market.

As for the actual purpose of this lotion, I was impressed it worked exceptionally well. The razor glided over my face without any kind of drag and evidently did what it was supposed to since I got an exceptionally close comfortable shave.

So 5 stars for the shave and 1 star for the Odor. I have plenty of after shave lotions that I really like and resent the fact that I am forced to use there odor if I want a good shave. Odorless for this product would be a definite plus. My 2 cats won't eat any treats I give them if I have this odor on my hands, at least I have 2 paw's up on my assessment of the odor. Ha!", 7 Ounce

For some reason our teen boy thought he should use this cleanser  without a washcloth... AND apparently a washcloth is an extremely important part of getting the upper hand on breakouts.

The Backstory
Our boy is 14 and is having to begin shaving several times a week. (Somehow it doesn't seem right that our baby is shaving. sigh.)  This shaving is aggravating his breakouts taking them up a level.  We got this Clean & Clear Cleanser to see what results we could get with an over the counter product.  After a week and a half there wasn't (initially) enough improvement so we made an appointment with a dermatologist.

We've since CANCELLED that appointment because I happened to watch boy wash his face one night. No Wash Cloth.  I smacked my forehead and took the time to show him how to properly wash his face.  Apparently this is a thing guys don't all know.  It's been a week since the demonstration (which included a mention that you don't scrub your face fiercely. That the skin there is delicate, particularly under the eyes....)  and his face is looking really good.  I suspect in another few days even the small spots will be gone.

Bubblegum (ahem, bubble fruit) isn't her favorite flavor, but she says it tastes just like the other sparkly toothpastes, and she likes the pump action because it's less mess than traditional tubes.  Yes, the pump and the rocket stand are definite pluses.  No more toothpaste all over the sink.  She still uses the toothpaste without complaint, so it's a thumbs up from her.",

This review is for Maximum Cavity Protection for growing adult teeth, which is a new concept.  The toothpaste comes in a stand up container that has a press style pump.  You press the pump to express toothpaste, which is a sparkly green colored gel.

The flavor is mild bubble fruit and that is exactly the way the toothpaste tastes, with just a hint of mint added.  The toothpaste offers maximum cavity protection with anticavity  0.24% fluoride.  It promises to fortify weak spots on enamel and helps to reduce plaque buildup with regular brushing.  It also freshens breathe.  It does not have whitening properties, which is the only reason I deducted a star.  My college age daughter brushes with  whitening toothpaste,  so she will brush with this toothpaste first, for cavity protection, to reduce plaque buildup, and to fortify weak spots on enamel, then finish with a whitening toothpaste (like Colgate Optic White) or mouthwash, for whitening benefits.

The toothpaste tastes good and offers some serious benefits for growing adult teeth.  Perfect for my 19 year old daughter!",

I do feel like the pumps leave a little bit left in the bottom though so you get a little bit less product with them. The pumps are definitely less messy though.

Our order came as 6 pumps of Colgate Maximum Cavity Protection in mild bubble fruit flavor. The toothpaste is a blue gel. Its slightly fruity but still minty. All 6 pumps had an expiration date of 10/2017 (this is 8/2016) so the expiration date is over a year out - plenty of time to use all 6 pumps.

That probably happened something like 15 years ago.  This is not the cheapest floss out there, but it really is the only one I can stand to use.  I just hate the waxy feeling of standard dental floss, but Glide is so much smoother.  (I am reminded of this every now and then when I run out of Glide and have to use free floss samples from the dentist until I can run to the store to restock.)

I started using Glide floss when I got braces (had them from age 25-28!).  I got tired of shredding floss on all the little wires, brackets, etc., and then trying to have to get it unstuck.  Glide wasn't 100% shred proof, but it outperformed any other floss I tried, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone with dental work to maneuver around (I had a wire glued to the back of my bottom teeth after my braces were removed, so I am stuck with a minor amount of dental work for life).

Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't even notice the change from original Glide (GoreTex) to the current product.  Well, I noticed the package was different, I suppose, but I felt like the product was still quite good.  I find it to be quite strong and not easily breakable (have even used it to sew up holes in dog toys).",

I can't say it makes flossing fun, but it certainly makes it much easier.

Here, the description was not kidding when it noted that these dried lavender blossoms provide a ""subtle"" scent. It's so subtle, I basically have to put my nose within inches of it to smell anything at all.  I've always enjoyed the scent of lavender, and with a busy household I had hoped to use this as a potpourri to improve various mystery smells that can occur in a home with two kids. Unfortunately, it didn't work the way I had hoped.  While the dried blossoms are amusing to play with, as dried herbs often are, they are not exactly pretty compared to flower petal potpourri. It's also sad that the bag is not designed to be resealed. If you're careful you may be able to use the original sticky seal, but you have to be very careful opening and closing the bag.

This is a generous amount of dried (loose) lavender blossoms designed to act in the same fashion as potpourri. The most important aspect to this product is the scent which I found to be delicate and natural. Lavender in general can be fairly overbearing, and you can smell this through the packet as it is relatively potent. However, it is not cloying or suffocating in its potency. I'm guessing this is because it's not as concentrated as a perfume or extract.

When you have the bag open and are exposed to all of it at once, it seems really strong, but as something you place in a location in lesser quantities, it doesn't tend to be so overbearing. I think that it strikes a good balance between being potent enough to have an effect and not being so potent as to make you queasy from a strong scent. I have had a lavender-scented face mask (the sort filled with beans that you heat or cool and apply to your face) for some time and found that putting that mask in a plastic zipper bag with a sachet made from these dried blossoms helped revived the fading scent quite well without have to risk staining the mask or making it smell too strong from using oils or perfume.

If there is any weak point to this, it is the presentation which can be a bit messy. I had to be very careful when opening the package not to spill the small, dried bits. It would have been better if it had come in a resealable package or a jar of some sort given how tiny they are. I decanted mine into a jar both to keep the scent contained in the long run and to more easily manage them. Still, since this point is intrinsic to the type of product this is (tiny dried blossoms), I'm not dinging it for that, but just noting it.",

What I've found is that lavender scents can be tricky. Some are intense and other times they can be rather weak or not even smell like lavender at all. The Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Blossom Linen Water is one that sadly falls into the latter category. I sprayed it on decorative pillows and at first it smelled really good They got the scent correct. But when I picked up the pillow 15 minutes later, it was no longer detectable. I tried it again, this time sniffing it 5 minutes later. Sadly, only the faintest hint of lavender greeted my nostrils. I was disappointed as Im a fan of aromatherapy, but this product just does not pass the muster.

I poured some full strength into my diffuser and it did work then, but that means using a lot of the product. Id rather just add a few drops of essential oil to water. Additionally, Maison has some questionable preservatives (Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and Methylchloroisothiazolinone (CMIT)) and FD&C Blue 1 and Red 33, rather than just pure scent.

The range of purple can vary between varieties, but should never be dull and gray.  I took a photo of this lavender next to a tin of lavender I bought a few months ago from Fairview Lavender Farm in Kentucky, and you can see a huge difference. The scent is also fresher in the tin than in the bag from Pre de Provence. I have ordered bulk dried lavender blossoms from Provence and it's not always as nice as domestic lavender, but it's rarely this dull.

That said, the scent is nice and it will work well in a loosely covered dish or sachet where appearance doesn't matter as much. I would probably refresh this lavender with a pure lavender oil after a while. It's okay, but it wouldn't be my first choice in dried lavender blossoms.",

These dried lavender blossoms are very potent too. We only used about half a handful. So, we still have almost the entire bag to use for later. It will last for a long time.

I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair, 1

I've used this brush nearly every day for at least 5 years now and the only reason I can tell its not brand-new is because the words ""Elizabeth Arden"" have worn off. I've never ever had a single bristle fall out of the brush, even when I'm washing it. I also take good care of it and wash it every week with baby shampoo.

The bristles are unbelievably soft and give a really even powder coverage and its very easy to vary the fullness of coverage with this brush. The angle is absolutely perfect for applying foundation. I find that this brush works really well with the Bare Minerals loose powder foundation, though I've gotten wonderful results using this brush with pressed powder as well.

We purchased this cape to use when my wife gives me and my son haircuts.

~PROS~
- Adjustable neck strap (works on me and my 7 year-old son)
- Good size at 36"" x 54""
- Repels water
- Appears to be well made

~CONS~
I would prefer a snap closure versus the velcro which tends to hold hair - a minor gripe though.

If you've never tried it, you won't believe how great it makes your skin feel and look, and this brush is a wonderful tool to start with.
First of all there are slight curves on the handle. This means that whether you grip the brush at the top or closer to the bottom it will be comfortable and not slip around. The bristles look to be natural, and have just the right amount of stiffness for exfoliation. Simply rub on your skin gently so that all of the dead skin flakes off.

The holder is a good size and even fits a thick bar of soap. The Velcro closure works very well to firmly keep the soap inside the sleeve. The soft washing side provides a nice bubbly lather. The exfoliating side, however, if pretty rough, even using a soft touch. I really can't use it as it hurts to the point of leaving scratches on my skin.

Both sudz up nicely with body wash and should work well with salt or sugar scrubs as well. It is easy to slip on and has a handy loop for hanging and drying in the shower.

The natural bamboo and jute mitt is a little small on my hand (6ft tall man) but it works. It should be fine on smaller hands. I'm a hairy guy and some of my body hair does attach itself to the mitt even after thoroughly rinsing and wringing out. That doesn't bother me, but it might limit shareablity with my wife.

If what one is truly seeking is to improve cellulite, one wants a cellulite creme with caffeine OR with any form of retinoid. Or a plastic surgeon. This whole topic was just explored on an episode of The Doctors.

However, let's talk about what this brush is great for: exfoliating! One can do a light dry rub before a shower or a lighter rub during the shower (be careful, wet skin is more delicate). This will keep skin youthful if one follows up with a light moisturizer.

The brush is well-made, looks nice, and has held up well this week (it appears brand new even though it is hanging in my shower).

Here are the ingredients, since listing them provides a good introduction to the product:

Water, Lactic Acid, Polyethylene, Soybean Oil, Cetearyl Alcohol, Pectin, Papaya Fruit, Lactobacillus Pumpkin Ferment Extract, Ceteareth-20, Cetyl Alcohol, Glyceryl Stearate, Dehydroxanthan Gum, PEG-100 Stearate, Salicylic Acid, SD Alcohol 40-B, Bergamot Fruit Oil, Sorbic Acid, Cinnamomum Cassia Leaf Oil, Honey, Acetic Acid, Lavender Oil, Potassium Sorbate, Tocopheryl Acetate, Retinyl Palmitate, Bromelain, Papain, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Phenoxyethanol, Geranium Maculatum Oil, Rosewood Wood Oil, Pogostemon Cablin Oil, Orange Oil, Linalool, Limonene, Cinnamal, Beta-Carotene (CI 75130), Chlorophyllin-Copper Complex (CI 75810).

This is basically a chemical and physical exfoliator in one.  It has lactic acid, papaya fruit, pumpkin extract, bromelain (digestive enzyme from pineapple), and papain (digestive enzyme from papaya).  I have seen all of these in peels before.  These ingredients are why you leave this on the face for one or two minutes after scrubbing with this product -- to give the ""peel"" portion time to do its work.

It also has some kind of grit in it.  I'm not sure what the grit is, but it works as a physical exfoliator.

This has a couple of other things that will especially help oily or acne-prone skin: salicylic acid, honey (has antibacterial properties), and retinyl palmitate (vitamin A).  Because of all the peeling ingredients and such, you will really want to use a good SPF product while you are using this to avoid sun damage.

This may make your skin more sensitive than usual.  I am a longtime exfoliator on a daily or every other day basis, so while I do get some tingling when I use this (usually every other day since this is a bit stronger than the sorts of things I normally use), it doesn't last -- once I wash the product off, the sensation goes away.  If you have sensitive skin, you will want to be super careful.  Maybe do a patch test first.  I think the tingling might be from the cinnamon; I have definitely had reactions to cinnamon oil in the past that turned my skin red, although it seems to be at a low enough level here that it is not doing that.

This is a green color, I'm guessing from the chlorophyll/copper complex.  It has the texture of a clay mask, maybe a bit thinner (easier to spread around on the face and rub in), and I can't quite place the smell, although this does have a lot of plant oils and extracts and I guess the scent is just a combination of those.  Maybe something citrusy but there are also some floral notes in there.

I personally don't find this drying.  I think the concentration of the grit/solids/beads is just about right as I can actually feel them moving over my face (some exfoliators don't have enough exfoliating particles to be worth it, but this is not one of those).  It washes off cleanly and has not caused any irritation to my skin.  I do think I am getting good results -- existing breakouts are clearing up faster than usual (this is really the only change in my routine) and I'm not getting new ones, even though I am using facial oils.  (I can only use facial oils if I am also using a good exfoliator.)

I do use kind of a lot of this at once.  I could probably get by with less and actually need to learn to get by with less because this is a pretty expensive product.  But, it works and I am going to dig through my stash (which is huge) to see if I can find more, because I am really liking the results.",

The product comes out as a pretty malachite green, with a nice, fresh smell. You massage it onto clean, wet skin, and the directions said to let it sit for up to two minutes. It feels a little warm, but not unduly so; there are those little microbeads so many skin treatments have nowadays.

My skin is hardy, so I let it stay on my skin for five minutes before I rinsed it off.

Wow...just wow! My skin looks phenomenal, and it feels as smooth as a baby's bottom.

This tub is huge, especially since you only need a tiny bit of this.  I plan on divvying it up into smaller containers so I can keep them around the house.

My son I can't quite get used to using the mouthwash, but my daughter does and I'm sure it's the non-alcoholic nature of the wash that makes it acceptable as it's not that sting-y.

SUMMARY
Since my young teenagers are using this mouthwash I wanted one without alcohol.  My daughter uses it on a regular basis and for about two years.  It's impossible to say whether the mouthwash has worked or if the kids are just flossing and brushing more effectively, but they have had fewer cavities and improved dental reports.", 16.9

After using some mouth rises I often need to rinse out my mouth with water because the taste is so strong  but not this one. After using this my mouth tastes fine.

I like the fact that this is supposed to replenish natural calcium back into enamel and reverse enamel softening as well.  I also like the fact that this is alcohol free.

I recently ordered the Mad Hippie Face Cream, Exfoliating Serum, and Antioxidant Facial Oil, and really like them a lot.

This Face Cream is not quite hydrating enough for me, but I've found that using the Antioxidant Facial Oil on top helps seal in moisture.

The Mad Hippie website also gives instructions for how to layer their products:

""We recommend gently massaging the vitamin C serum into your skin in the morning after washing and drying thoroughly.  Wait 5 minutes after applying the serum & apply the creams.  Apply the face cream to the entire face, including eye area, then apply the eye cream beside and below the eyesmaking sure to rub both creams in well, particularly around wrinkle prone areas.  Follow this with our extra hydrating antioxidant facial oil.

At night, follow the same steps but replace the vitamin C serum with an exfoliant:  either the exfoliating serum or vitamin A serum.  If just using the creams, wait a couple minutes after washing your face when skin is fully dry to apply. The facial SPF should be used as the final and last step of your morning routine.""", Single Pack

Other than that, I don't think it is that great. The orthodontist said the priority should be flossing and brushing, not the Waterpik. He said the Waterpik does not have enough pressure to remove plaque. This is really just for getting the big chunks of food before I brush and floss with Oral-B Superfloss.
Before I got braces, I occasionally used the Waterpik but I can't say it did much for me.
It has been a year and I have noticed a puddle of water around the Waterpik after I turn it off. I think the handle is now leaking.
After my braces come off I will probably throw the Waterpik away.

UPDATE: I was right. The handle does in fact leak. I could buy a replacement handle for $10 but I don't want to. Overall, the Waterpik lasted about a year, which is not acceptable for a $50 item.",

The hand held WP-450 model has a 2-year warranty, but I've never had the batteries last for two years. Some don't make it to 18 months. The one I bought a year ago now only lasts for about 4 or 5 sessions before the charge dies. I recharge them for over 24 yours when they get week, which is what Waterpik recommends. So I have two so I can use one while the other one charges. Got tired of all this and got this plug in model and I wish I had done this several years ago. Being tethered to the hose is not a problem at all, the hand unit is much lighter and more maneuverable than the battery model, lighter too. I use this on #7 setting on the dial and it is just about the same as my old 450 units with a fresh charge. The highest setting is really powerful! Control easy to use, uses the same tips as my old units. I floss first, lightly brush with a tooth brush, then use a Sonicare. After this routing my hygienist still found food under my gums during a routing cleaning! That is when I added the Waterpik to my routine and they never found food after that again. Amazing to see what flossing and brushing with a Sonicare leaves behind. I am 67 and my gums have receded, so I need the extra flushing power of a water flosser. Dental floss does not get down between the gum and base of the tooth. I recommend this for anyone who is either starting out with your first water flosser or using a rechargable unit that you don't want to replace every 18 months because the battery is failing. Extra tips store in the lid to the tank. Tank easy to remove for cleaning. Can even be washed in the dishwasher if you remove the rubber valve/plug unit.

Many years have past and I have shot through quite a few Waterpik models and this is the current one I own. It is a little more evolved than its predecessors, but it still performs in pretty much the same way it always has. You fill the reservoir with water, attach the head to the handle which has a control to turn the water stream on and off, and then turn the device on to produce a spray of water as you move the head around to remove debris from between your teeth and gums. I think of the Waterpik as a power washer for the teeth and gums because it forces out pressurized water to irrigate those areas.
This model has a varying speed control to increase the water pressure to whatever is comfortable and effective for the individual user. It also comes with six different tips. While I use the flossing tip, there are tips for brace wearers, people who have crowns,etc, a tongue cleaner, and a couple of other tips for specific functions.
Other than eliminating the need to floss, the Waterpik has been beneficial to me. My teeth are always clean, I don't have gum disease, plaque, dental decay, etc.
The Waterpik is easy to use and maintain and has  paid for itself many times over since I never buy floss.",

First, read the instructions.  Start off with low pressure as this little pump can shoot out quite an aquatic projectile!  Just make sure you have the nozzle turned AWAY from your eyes.  NEVER let this anywhere near your eyes.  Once you have regulated the flow to where you want it, you are ready to enter a whole new world of oral health!

This little Godsend also comes with a tongue cleaner.  After you give yourself a good oral cleansing, you and your dentist will have entered into a new phase of your oral health partnership.  This is EXCELLENT for your tongue, teeth and gums and does a very thorough job.  You reduce placque and bacteria considerably and the water jet can reach places where dental floss never reaches.",

After looking at all the models, we choose this one. It holds a lot of water. It has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

I looked at the ones that were battery powered but I didn't think they would hold enough water and I couldn't see him refilling it to finish. This model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

There is a huge variety of tips but I don't think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

The tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

It is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.

It saves sooo much time and effort. Honestly, if I use this and then use regular floss string afterward, I never have anything come out on the string. I love this Waterpik! My teeth feel so clean after using it.

It is easy to use. You just fill the basin with water, pick your setting with the dial, and turn it on. It is a little messy - water run off - but it is worth it! I use it on the highest setting with no discomfort or pain at all. The different heads are all very useful and store right in the lid of the basin. It flips open and there is a compartmnt to keep them all. The coiled cord stays neatly in place in the holster when not in use.

I use a basin full of water, then refill with half water/half mouthwash and my mouth and teeth feel so clean and so smooth. It feels like I just left the dentist. It is also easy to clean from behind the teeth as well.

I went home and started using the Sonicare I had bought but never plugged in. That was good, but not enough - I bought a Waterpik because obviously flossing wasn't cutting it.

I had never used a Waterpik before, and it was some revelation! I'm still amazed that there are some Waterpik oldtimers who say this machine isn't strong enough...uh, for what? Peeling paint off a brick wall? This thing absolutely knocked my socks off when it came to the PRESSURE.

I started out at 2 and worked my way up to 7 - it still stings like mad, but I'm getting used to it by now. I put Listerine in the tank to increase the anti-bacteria result.

My dentist went on vacation, and I had to cancel another appointment, so it happened that almost two months had elapsed since the last time I had seen him. In that time, I faithfully brushed with the Sonicare four times a day and used the Waterpik at least once (several tankfuls of water and Listerine worth.)

Regarding the leaking people talk about - the only time the tank leaks, I notice, is if I put my fingers on the seal when I'm refilling it. If I'm careful to keep my fingers away from that seal, the tank is water tight.

So when I returned for my check-up, the dentist was AMAZED. He wasn't sure what I had done, but he said my gums looked pink and healthy! He had said initially I'd have to get my teeth cleaned every three months because I must be one of those people who gets a tartar build up quicker than other people...well, I had worked religiously on scaling back the plaque. (I had also bought a dental mirror so I could check the back of my front teeth for telltale plaque residue.)

Hmmm, no comment about that plaque...was it because there WASN'T any? My dentist asked me if I had been eating because there was so little build up (I had to tear that out of him because I KNEW he didn't want to give me credit for working that hard on my dental hygiene!)

The area where the water came out was small and the spray could be directed easily. It did not make a mess. It was fantastic for cleaning my teeth, which had braces.

Now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a WaterPik.

This thing is unbelievable. The spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. Even I, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. This is a mess. I am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.

Tip: Put the device in the mouth, then turn it on. Try to use it with your mouth closed or nearly closed and shut it off before you remove it from your mouth.

After reading other customer reviews, to prevent possible leakage, we take the unit apart and dump out the water after each usage.

Do your research regarding other models available as well as this one. The customer reviews here on Amazon are eye-opening.

I wish they made the WaterPik like the original ones that lasted for many years and were easier to manage.

Update: One child has been using this for 16 months and it is still functional.

To get the most out of the unit you have to read the manual. It clearly states that you should not leave water in the reservoir (why you would want to anyway is beyond me - why would anyone want to use stale water?). If you don't leave water in it, it won't leak out on your counter. Pretty simple equation there.

I agree with several others that the tongue cleaning attachments are basically useless. They don't fit into the holder anyway, so just toss them out. Sure, try it, but I'll bet you'll find it to be basically useless compared with a true tongue cleaner (i.e., a scraper type device).

The water reservoir could be a bit bigger - an additional 20% bigger would be nice. But, it's very easy to fill even when the unit is running (keep a glass of water handy and just pour it in when the water level is at the half-way point). Simple and easy, and the smaller reservoir does have the benefit of keeping the unit size nice and compact.

Sound level is very low compared with past WaterPik units. No, it's not silent, but it is no more noise than you would get with any other electric appliance in the bathroom such as an electric toothbrush or a shaver.  In fact, it is less noise than my shaver.

The auto-retractable hose is a very nice touch and keeps everything neat. Again, a couple inches longer would be nice, but there's the compact size trade-off again.

In actual performance - wow!  You will never believe that your teeth could get this clean! Wonderful feeling. There is a wide range of power adjustments ranging from very gentle to ouch! I've found setting the dial to the 5/6 range gives a good cleaning without any discomfort.

Good performance at a good price -- can't ask for more than that.",

The toothbrush has 5 settings, and it lists them in the description.  I prefer the sensitive setting, as I recently had gum surgery and am now very aware of how hard I am brushing, which leads me into that nice feature.  This toothbrush will slow and the red light will come on if you are brushing too hard.  I like that, because it reminds me to use lighter pressure.  It comes with a separate display that keeps track of how long you are brushing, and also has a clock.  The brush pauses when it is time to switch sides.  I like the carrying case, as you can place the unit and the separate brushes in it.

I think it is a bit much with the display, personally.  The separate display portion is kind of a hassle.  I also wish it had a setting memory.  Every time you restart the toothbrush, it starts over at the first setting, so I have to press the arrow down to get to the sensitive setting.  It takes about 7 seconds, so you have wasted that time with the brush out of your mouth, trying to find the correct setting you like.

I like it, it works well, there are just a few things I would prefer be different.  I prefer a little more of a simplistic toothbrush.",
4743,5,False,2013-12-04,A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,B00CZH3K1C,Margaret P.,"The Crest + Oral-Professional Gingivitis Kit has an electric toothbrush plus timer and case, toothpaste, floss, and mouthwash in a disposable tote bag. There is a selection of four brush heads included, and I like the spinning head the best.  I have been using an Oral-B 1000 model for a few weeks so can compare it to this high-end 5000 model.

The charging base is nice, with no wall wart or metal contacts. At least when new, the battery will last for more than week of twice- or thrice-daily brushings. There are several brushing modes, including one for sensitive teeth and a mode with longer brushing times.  The sensitive mode is noticeably gentler.

This model will alert when a 30 or 45 second brushing time per quadrant has finished, by pulsing and with the little radio timer.  I don't really like the timer feature but it would be very helpful to teach a child how to brush; the visual reinforcement is effective.

The brush tips change easily but don't come off under use and they have colored rings to identify brush heads for multiple users. The handle is just the right size and has soft-touch plastic so it is comfortable and easy to grip. It really is waterproof because I have been using it in the shower with no problems. I would hesitate to actually immerse the bottom of the handle, though.

It is necessary to use a soft touch with these brushes; it is not pressure but the movement of the bristles that disturbs the plaque. Be especially careful if you have gum recession or crowns.  Fortunately, this model warns about using too much pressure.  I find this helpful.

There is an accessory that fits over the charging base to hold extra toothbrush heads which some may find useful as well as a carrying case.  I probably wouldn't bother with the weight and bulk when traveling and will continue to carry a manual toothbrush.

No complaints at all with this toothbrush except that the handle shows water and toothpaste residue and the heads are rather costly compared to a manual toothbrush. I do think it's worth the expense, though, for the ease in brushing, although the less-expensive models have the same basic features. An electric toothbrush would be especially helpful for anyone with arthritis in the hands.",
4744,5,False,2013-12-02,A1QBOC76MIOJYP,B00CZH3K1C,MyPenName,"Overall, this is an amazing value and an awesome kit. The toothbrush is just wonderful and comes with plenty of heads for different cleaning/issues.. The mouthwash is a smaller sized bottle, but plenty to see if you like it and if it works well for you. Toothpaste and floss are full sized. This is a mouth transformation kit. If you have gum issues, or just want to take better care of your gums, this is the kit for you.

Previously I was using Sonicare Diamondclean and I was in love with it. Once I tried this Oral B toothbrush, I gave up on my Sonicare. I am 37, I smoke cigarettes, drink A LOT of energy drinks, and have braces. I NEED extra gum care and this toothbrush along with the mouthwash and toothpaste give me that. I would say that the toothbrush alone has made a big difference from when I was using the Sonicare.

I love that I can actually feel it working on my gums. It really feels like a gum massage. The smaller part of the head that moves separately is an awesome addition. That is where I feel the extra attention and the gum care. My teeth feel SO CLEAN after brushing with this one. I like that it is a more vigorous cleaning than with the Sonicare. It actually took me a long time to get used to the gentle cleaning that Sonicare toothbrushes give. I had been using Sonicare for about 10 years, so eventually I got used to it, although I never really did feel like they were really scrubbing as much as I liked. My teeth felt clean, but there was just something missing. This Oral B fills in the gap and gives me everything I am looking for, and then some. I just feel like my whole mouth is clean and fresh after using the Oral B.

The mouthwash is great for gums. I put some in my Waterpik (half mouthwash/half water) and I can tell a difference in the health and appearance of my gums. I do not get sore spots anymore and the sensitive areas are gone. Because of my braces, I tend to get gaps between my teeth down at the gumline. Debris get in there from eating and it can be painful and stay sore for a while. This mouthwash in the Waterpik really helps with all of the irritation.

The toothpaste is pretty good, although I think I will stick to my regular whitening toothpaste. I like a bit more bold mint flavor and I do need the whitening benefits due to cigarette smoking. Otherwise, it seems like a good toothpaste. It is a smoother mint flavor and seems to have almost a soothing effect on sore areas of the gum and mouth, so that is a plus when needed.

Mainly, I am just super impressed with the toothbrush. I had also tried the Oral B 7000 (black) but I much prefer this 5000 version. The 7000 was very impressive and the first Oral B to really make me switch from Sonicare, but just too loud. The 5000 here in this bundle just provides a better experience overall, without all of the noise. I thought the 7000 would end up being better, but it is not. It is sleek looking in black, but I just prefer the 5000 - I mean I really LOVE IT. The attention to the gums and the way it cleans so thoroughly and literally reaches every surface of the tooth, (even all around my braces!!!) is just amazing.

If you are going to invest in a good toothbrush, this is THE ONE to buy. if you need the extra gum care and attention this is the kit to buy.

Or if it was a 'get all this other stuff free when you buy the toothbrush' kind of thing. It's all you need for a healthy mouth in a re-usable little tote. And if you happen to be a dentist looking at this, there is cute little 'luggage tag' attached to it that has a sleeve for your business card. In six months when your client is using the tote for groceries, they just might look at that tag and remember to make an appointment!

Now lets look at what's inside.
First, there is one of those toothbrushes that syncs with a fun little device that tells you how you're brushing. GREAT for kids, but really nice for adults, too. It will even tell you if you are brushing too hard or soft. I love it! It does everything but reach in your mouth and brush FOR you.
The included toothpaste is slightly runny for a stand-up tube, but tastes fresh.
Next there is the Crest mouthwash. They claim it doesn't sting, and they're right. The mint lasts just long enough, with some others it spoils your taste buds for hours.
Finally, some dental floss. I prefer flossing picks but it certainly completes the package.

CONS

- Initial minty taste is fine (glad I brush afterwards), but aftertaste lingers forever and is not pleasant.
- Unfortunately, I have breakfast about 20 minutes after rinsing with this and brushing and my food doesn't taste right.

PROS

- No burning sensation (no alcohol) and obviously contains ingredients that are good for oral hygiene.

After using it, your breath is definitely minty fresh... BUT there's a weird chemical after-taste that lasts and lasts; which my husband and myself found to be unpleasant.

On the non-pro-health side, it's a chemical concoction.  It contains ""propylparaben"" which is know to mimic estrogen.  It also contains Red 33, which can be found in Cutex Nail Polish remover.

Now really, given that we are adults-over-50, can't we just have clear mouth wash.  Or whatever color the Cetylpyridinium Chloride gives the liquid.  Because that's the only active ingredient: Cetylpyridinium Chloride.  (also used in some pesticides because it fights fungus.)

I want my tummy flat and my hair poofy, somehow my body got confused - with opposite results, so I have flat, yet still frizzy, hair. In the meantime I'm at that ""I need a haircut"" stage where I'm not sure what I want to do with it, so it's sort of half grown out, not long enough for headbands or to hold back, not short enough to really be a style, just unmanageable.

I decided what the heck and tried some Toni&guy plumping whip to see if I could whip it back into shape. The whip is a semi solid, sort of like coconut oil texture when it gets cool. The scent is very light and doesn't really smell of anything, no floral or perfume smell. The directions say to use a walnut size scoop, but since my hair is short I used about half that. Towel dry, scoop, put on hair, run through, dry. Easy enough, the whip didn't feel heavy on my fingers or hair, it rubbed through easily and I got out my blow dryer and went to work.

The crown and top of my hair plumped right up, and styled easily. I blew it flat by the ears so it wouldn't stick out and that worked too, so if you're doing a convoluted have lift half flat style this will work just fine. There is no residue feeling when I run my hand through my hair, and the volume probably increased by a good half.

Here are the ingredients since the listing on the product page seems to cut off:

Water, caprylic/capric triglyceride, glyceryl stearate, cetyl alcohol, glycerin, cetearyl alcohol, PEG-100 stearate, dimethicone, stearic acid, cetearyl glucoside, tocopherol, aloe barbadensis leaf juice, lavender flower extract, camellia sinensis leaf extract, grape seed oil, bisabolol, jojoba seed oil, sodium hyaluronate, panthenol, PEG/PPG-4/12 dimethicone, silica, xanthan gum, phenoxyethanol, benzyl alcohol, aminomethyl propanol.

There is nothing in here that really makes it any more special than an average facial moisturizer.  It has some moisturizing ingredients (caprylic/capric triglycerides, glycerin, aloe, sodium hyaluronate, grapeseed oil, jojoba oil).  It has some antioxidants (from the tea leaf extract).  The moisturizing effects may help diminish the appearance of fine lines; hyaluronate, for example, holds on to a lot of water and may have a plumping effect.  I don't have much in the way of fine lines, but I am not really seeing a difference in the ones I do have after applying this every morning for awhile now.

For what it's worth, this does have some silicones in it.

If you have really sensitive eyes and can't use most other eye creams, this could be an option for you.  It is non-irritating, even when used on sensitive/thin skin.  I have been using this in the morning before putting in my contact lenses and it doesn't bother my eyes at all.  You don't need a lot at once so one container will last a long time, making this a pretty good value.

But, in the end, I feel like this is not the eye cream for me.  I am looking for something with a few more active ingredients designed specifically for the eye area.",

As far as results go your mileage will vary but I do have one tooth in particular with mild, persistent issues whenever it comes into contact with ice. The strip does tone done the sensation by approximately 50% in my estimation so not necessarily an insta-cure but good enough to be noticeable.

Couple of things to keep in mind - each strip is very small and will cover 1 or 2 teeth each. The strips also do not 'stick' very well to the tooth so you'll need to be patient during the 10 minutes of application and try not to talk or move your mouth around.

Sometimes acidic foods can irritate this area and cause sensitivity. These strips are very easy to use. You just press one of the straps against the tooth and gum that is hurting and leave it in place for 10 minutes. I was really surprised that this actually worked and continued to work for several days. I am on the seventh day now and my tooth feels just slightly sensitive again. I do eat a lot of acidic foods and drink kombucha which is kind of sour so that may contribute to the strips not lasting as long.

You place one in your mouth on the gum line, outside of the tongue area, next to the aching tooth and leave in place for ten minutes. The instructions do not say to trim the plastic strip to fit, but in actual use, it was necessary to trim the strip in order to get the strip in place and have a comfortable fit for an aching  lower molar.

These worked very well, my son (30 years old, lives with me because he is disabled) had a tooth ache two weeks ago, we used one of these and his tooth hasn't bothered him since, but it was awkward to put in place, after one failed attempt of him trying to put a strip, we resorted to trimming the wide plastic strip before removing the backing and I put on a pair of disposable medical gloves and put the strip in for him.

It was still sensitive, but I didn't have the screaming sensitivity that I usually have.  I think with continued use, this can dramatically minimize the sensitivity.

The strips are kind of hard to get off the sheet.  I wasn't sure if I was doing it right, and there weren't any instructions.  You have a big sheet of plastic with a little piece of the sensitivity strip in the middle.  You have to peel that part off, but it doesn't come off easily.  It is a little tricky to do.  I didn't notice a taste.  You aren't supposed to eat or drink for 30 minutes after you use them and you only leave them on for 10 minutes.

Leave them on for ten minutes and abstain from eating or drinking for another half hour. The effect is supposed to last for up to a month.

So far these have provided relief and  are as effective as the toothpastes. They don't cover a large area and it takes some dexterity to get them in harder to reach places.

As you can see from the product image, this comes with two products -- a lip stain and a balm -- in one container.  I have found that I only needed to apply the lip stain (or liquid lipstick, or whatever you want to call it) once and it lasted throughout an entire work day.  So they're not lying about the 16 hours (well, I probably wore it for more like 10 or 11 hours, but it still looked good and was a bit difficult to remove at the end of that time).  I applied it using the doefoot applicator it comes with and then kept my lips slightly open while I let it dry.

I gave it a few minutes and did other things to get ready, then applied the balm over it.  The balm has a similar applicator to the lip stain part.  The balm (or you might call it a gloss) is clear.  It did pick up some of the color of the stain on the applicator when I used it, but no big deal since I'm only going to ever use the balm *with* the stain.  Anyway, although the stain itself was rather drying, using the second step made this product completely comfortable to wear.  I did have to reapply the balm a few times throughout the day.

I did not get much color transfer to mugs and I did not lose much color over the course of the day.  I found the appearance of the product quite acceptable at the end of the day.  It was actually a bit difficult to get off; I used a dual phase liquid makeup remover on a cotton pad and I kind of had to scrub.  You may want to finish up with a lip scrub to ensure complete removal.  Anyway, this stuff has staying power.

The berry color I had was more of a cool red than a true berry color, at least on my lips.  I really liked the color.  I'm pale, but I think it would show up on people with darker skin tones as well.  This was non-irritating and didn't have a noticeable fragrance.

I have some flyaway hair and split ends, but nothing too overwhelming. My main concerns are shine enhancement/retention, ease of combing out, and body retention. My hair can take some pretty heavy conditioning without flattening out.

This conditioner left my hair very soft and made it easy to comb through my wet hair after shampooing and conditioning. It's creamy and thick so you don't need a large amount for coverage, even with relatively voluminous hair. While this didn't do too much to enhance shine, it didn't dull what I already had. I found that it smoothed hair a little less (some ""frizzy"" parts) than some conditioners in the lower portions (despite my attention to even distribution) and did a better job smoothing the top. It did not suppress the natural waves my hair has or weigh it down.

A small dab is all that is needed to adequately work through the hair. The product easily rinses out and does leave a nice, silky finish that holds up for hours on untreated hair.

I had hoped that I would be able to bury my nose in this bar from Pre de Provence and imagine that I had just opened a bottle of patchouli essential oil.  No, no, it did not happen.  While it is a lovely fragrance, it is somewhat meek and mild.  Maybe that is what you are looking for, but I wanted deep, true, powerful patchouli.

With this bar from Pre de Provence I do get rich, smoothing and soothing moisturizing.  It was opportune that I had recently purchased two bars of soap from Plantlife, patchouli and sandalwood.  Oh, my!  Those fragrances are potent and wonderful!  Way more so than those from Pre de Provence.  Having the two patchouli bars at the same time allowed me to see the moisturizing qualities of both soaps.  The Plantlife dried my skin.  This Pre de Provence always left my skin soft and supple.  It was a BIG difference; so easy to see when I had the two together.

So, when it comes to the patchouli and the sandalwood soaps, which one you would like better depends on what you are looking for in a soap:  True potent fragrance or moisturizing luxury.  For me it boils down to my skin's needs in the cooler, drier months, and that means I go with the Pre de Provence.

By reading lots of reviews, I notice that many people do not like potent scents, and prefer light, delicate or unobtrusive fragrances.  I am not one of them.  I don't particularly like heavy, sweet and cloying scents, but I do love to breathe in intense, true fragrances.  (I say all this not to disrespect those who like unscented or light scents, but to let you know where my rating is coming from.)

I wanted to take a deep breath with my nose right up on this large bar of sandalwood and be able to say, ""Ahhh, sandalwood!""  No, that did not happen.  Yes, the sandalwood fragrance is there, but there are other scents as well, and together, it all gentles down the sandalwood.  It is a lovely soap, but not the sandalwood fragrance I was hoping for.

It has way more sandalwood fragrance than this Pre de Provence.

When using the Pre de Provence, I definitely noticed that my legs, feet, arms, hands were not dry.  As soon as I went back to the Plantlife--just one day--that soap dried out my skin.

So, depends on what you are looking for in your soap.  If you want the intense fragrance, choose Plantlife, and give up soft and smooth skin.  I found both to give great lather, but only the Pre de Provence gave moisture.

Nothing I've found blends into my skin like Shea Butter, and I have been religiously using Pre de Provence lotions with Shea Butter for a while now.

Poza,"This is an average-sized bar of scented French-milled, French-made soap designed to over a more luxurious experience than consumer-grade soaps. I will be comparing this both in use and in price to average body bars, but my rating takes into the account that this is a premium product which offers certain benefits that you cannot get from products like basic Ivory soap or Kirkland's body bar. This gets extra points for those added qualities.

I will note the price differences first. This is a 150-gram bar for a little under $5 whereas a 130-gram bar of Kirkland signature will cost you an average of 66 cents. Both bars will get you equally clean, but that is really the only point where the products overlap. Besides the truly lovely rose scent of this bar (it smells like a real rose  mild and not too overbearing, but present), it has a much better feel. The lather is creamier and feels silkier on the skin. One point about it that I was really happy about was that it wasn't so perfumey that I walked out of the shower smelling as if I'd applied a scent to my skin. This was more of an enjoyable transient experience in which I enjoyed the scent while I was using it, but didn't subject others to it once I was out of the bath. In my case, my husband is super sensitive to perfume-like smells so this worked for me. If you're looking for something longer lasting, this may not be what you're after.

In terms of how it leaves my skin, this is absolutely better for not drying my skin out. I'm guessing that this is the shea butter replenishing to some extent what oils the soap is stripping off when you use the soap. I wouldn't say that you don't need an added moisturizer after using it (at least I still needed moisturizer), but it's definitely gentler than other bars that I've used.

The bar is very hard or solid in a way that consumer-grade bars are not. This is because of the quad-milling that is advertised on the product page. I had not heard about this process before trying this soap, but it reduces the water content of the bars and makes them last longer. I will note that my average bar of soap will tend to melt in the shower and there are little stalactites of soap residue on my soap dish on my shower caddy where the soap has dissolved and the residue has drained off and hardened (which represents a loss of soap/value). This soap doesn't do that. It dries harder and firmer and doesn't melt away at the edges. That means that it lasts a lot longer. I can't do a scientific test or anything, but my best guess is that I got 3x the mileage out of this bar than the Kirkland bars that I usually use (and possibly 4x the use compared to Ivory, which I find melts away much more rapidly than any other soap). This is still a more expensive soap on average than consumer-grade brands, but it isn't quite as expensive as it seems when you factor in longevity and the quality of experience is rather markedly better in terms of the feel and the scent.", 150 Gram

They are made with vegetable oil only, no animal fat, and are quadruple-milled to last a long time.

The variety of fragrances is impressive, and they all smell so nice that its hard to decide on a favorite.  Agrumes (citrus) smells distinctly of grapefruit with lemony notes and the verbena smells as fresh as if you had just plucked a leaf from the bush and crushed it in your hand.  The almond, pomegranate, and mirabelle (plum) will make your mouth water.  The florals such as violette and angels trumpet are a pleasant change from  offensive artificial floral scents.

My skin visually appears more moisturized when I use this  soap (compared to the brand that was previously in my shower). I still required lotion but could have skipped it without feeling dry and itchy.

 Linden smells like an ultra-mild lily-of-the-valley fragrance.  Peony smells... like a peony (assumption as I've never sniffed one before). I don't like the way that Angel's Trumpet smells.  It doesn't impact my rating... this just isn't the fragrance for me. I don't dislike it enough to let it go to waste so this isn't a deal breaker.

When using this soap the fragrance is stronger in the air than on my skin. It creates a relaxing experience without leaving the skin heavily perfumed.

The color of the soap is a bright green-yellow. More yellow. Peony is a soft blush/shell pink. Angel Trumpet is a yellow-beige that my kids describe as r sandy-yellow. There is a marbled like consistency to this barbiturates am overall smooth feel.  The bars have a 12/2019 expiration date on them.a

The soap does not get water-logged and squishy and that is a great indicator that the bar will last more than a week.

The soap itself is smooth and lathers pretty well. It is very soft, feels nice on the skin and does actually clean you off. I found that I needed to rinse a little more than usual to get the last residue of it off though.

This is the first bar of ""Peony"" I've tried and it's very good. Given the name, it's no surprise it's a floral scent; I'd say it leans more feminine than masculine, but I'd also say its unisex if you like soft florals.

I've been a fan for years.  Pre de Provence has greatly expanded their line over the past few years, and more and more of them are showing up on Amazon.  To have such wonderful French products available here at the touch of my computer screen is a real treat!
This line of soaps with Shea butter is especially comforting and gratifying.  I tried the lavender fragrance in this line and it is very fragrant.  It is floral and spicy and not cloyingly sweet.  It is a sophisticated fragrance, and it is potent and true lavender.  Just lovely!

The shea butter in this bar seems to make the lather glide smoothly across my skin.  It washes off well, yet seems to leave a softness behind that clings to my skin.  The little brownish pieces in the bar are actually pieces of petal.  I does not add any coarseness to the bar, and I think it may be included just to add to the ""artisanal"" look.  But maybe it works to hold essential oil, too.
The fragrance lasts only for an hour or two, and that is as it should be, I think.  It does not interfere with the perfume I wear.  The lavender fragrance is mostly restricted to the bath.", 250 Gram

However, after using this soap, I may have to rethink that habit. This soap really does seem to leave skin feeling both clean (with no film left after rinsing) and quite soft. The claims on the back about containing 1/4 moisturizing cream appear to be quite true. Compared to the sometimes tight, post shower feel that I get with my usual choice of soap (generally the plain Kirkland brand at Costco), this is clearly a superior bar of soap.

The only drawback to this soap is the scent, which is the usual strong smell for men's hair and body products. If it were a little less intense, it'd be okay, but it is so strong that the paper box the soap comes in reeks of it. If you're okay with the strong smell and you want something which leaves you very clean but still with soft skin, this is a pretty good choice which is several cuts above the cheap stuff.", 4 Ounce (8 Count)

Today's razors are so much better than years ago.

Even though this is a wet or dry shave razor it seemed to drag a bit when dry shaving. Maybe because of some slight perspiration I don't know, but it did not move smoothly over my skin. Than I thought of Williams Lectric Shave, something I have heard of for years but never tried.

The first thing I did when I got it home was smell it and was not impressed with the odor, in fact I thought it was extremely unpleasent. I figured I'll use it to shave, than wash it off and that will be the end of it. But NOooo I shaved than washed it off 1 time, 2 times than a third time and the smell did not disappear from my face or hands. Plus the odor lingered for hours. I don't know if it is just me but I think the smell is just awful And I would not buy it again just for that reason. I would check out the other brands on the market.

As for the actual purpose of this lotion, I was impressed it worked exceptionally well. The razor glided over my face without any kind of drag and evidently did what it was supposed to since I got an exceptionally close comfortable shave.

So 5 stars for the shave and 1 star for the Odor. I have plenty of after shave lotions that I really like and resent the fact that I am forced to use there odor if I want a good shave. Odorless for this product would be a definite plus. My 2 cats won't eat any treats I give them if I have this odor on my hands, at least I have 2 paw's up on my assessment of the odor. Ha!", 7 Ounce

I've always enjoyed the scent of lavender, and with a busy household I had hoped to use this as a potpourri to improve various mystery smells that can occur in a home with two kids. Unfortunately, it didn't work the way I had hoped.  While the dried blossoms are amusing to play with, as dried herbs often are, they are not exactly pretty compared to flower petal potpourri. It's also sad that the bag is not designed to be resealed. If you're careful you may be able to use the original sticky seal, but you have to be very careful opening and closing the bag.

This is a generous amount of dried (loose) lavender blossoms designed to act in the same fashion as potpourri. The most important aspect to this product is the scent which I found to be delicate and natural. Lavender in general can be fairly overbearing, and you can smell this through the packet as it is relatively potent. However, it is not cloying or suffocating in its potency. I'm guessing this is because it's not as concentrated as a perfume or extract.

When you have the bag open and are exposed to all of it at once, it seems really strong, but as something you place in a location in lesser quantities, it doesn't tend to be so overbearing. I think that it strikes a good balance between being potent enough to have an effect and not being so potent as to make you queasy from a strong scent. I have had a lavender-scented face mask (the sort filled with beans that you heat or cool and apply to your face) for some time and found that putting that mask in a plastic zipper bag with a sachet made from these dried blossoms helped revived the fading scent quite well without have to risk staining the mask or making it smell too strong from using oils or perfume.

If there is any weak point to this, it is the presentation which can be a bit messy. I had to be very careful when opening the package not to spill the small, dried bits. It would have been better if it had come in a resealable package or a jar of some sort given how tiny they are. I decanted mine into a jar both to keep the scent contained in the long run and to more easily manage them. Still, since this point is intrinsic to the type of product this is (tiny dried blossoms), I'm not dinging it for that, but just noting it.",

The Pre De Provence Maison French Lavender Blossom Linen Water is one that sadly falls into the latter category. I sprayed it on decorative pillows and at first it smelled really good They got the scent correct. But when I picked up the pillow 15 minutes later, it was no longer detectable. I tried it again, this time sniffing it 5 minutes later. Sadly, only the faintest hint of lavender greeted my nostrils. I was disappointed as Im a fan of aromatherapy, but this product just does not pass the muster.

I poured some full strength into my diffuser and it did work then, but that means using a lot of the product. Id rather just add a few drops of essential oil to water. Additionally, Maison has some questionable preservatives (Methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and Methylchloroisothiazolinone (CMIT)) and FD&C Blue 1 and Red 33, rather than just pure scent.

The range of purple can vary between varieties, but should never be dull and gray.  I took a photo of this lavender next to a tin of lavender I bought a few months ago from Fairview Lavender Farm in Kentucky, and you can see a huge difference. The scent is also fresher in the tin than in the bag from Pre de Provence. I have ordered bulk dried lavender blossoms from Provence and it's not always as nice as domestic lavender, but it's rarely this dull.

That said, the scent is nice and it will work well in a loosely covered dish or sachet where appearance doesn't matter as much. I would probably refresh this lavender with a pure lavender oil after a while. It's okay, but it wouldn't be my first choice in dried lavender blossoms.",

When the bag arrived and we smelled it, we had the brilliant idea to put it in our scent warmer (ceramic warmer that is warmed by an electronic light). It worked out so well! Our house smells like lavender and it is amazing.

These dried lavender blossoms are very potent too. We only used about half a handful. So, we still have almost the entire bag to use for later. It will last for a long time.

I iron clothes inside out if I'm going to use any spray, and a light spritz left a wonderful fragrance, not overwhelming, and didn't stain my clothes.

I love Essie nail polish, I have a nice size collection of the regular polish. I also love gel nail polish - I have my own tools (LED light).

Standard nail polish never lasts more than 24 hours on my fingernail no matter what I do. Therefore I was excited to try the 2 step polish that requires no LED light but resembles Gel Polish and a hopes for a 14 day wear.

I did two test runs:

Test 1:
Did no nail prep -I just followed directions, two coats of color, one coat of top.  Dries quickly, leaves great gloss

Day 1: Looks great
Day 2: Very small chipping to start on dominate hand
Day 3: Removed: Chipping on 85% of nails

Test 2:
I removed all the polish and prep my nails this time just as I would with doing real GELs. (Push back cuticle, buff nail to remove shine, cleans, add dehydrator, two coats color, one coat of top.

Day 1-2: Looks great, the shine lasted
Day 3: Chipping starting on dominate hand
Day 4: Removed

Granted, I did get a longer wear out of this polish than I have my typical Essie nail polish (or any brand for that matter).  I just have a naturally oil nail bed, but doing some of the prep-work I was able to get one more extra day of the polish.  So this is defiantly an improvement!

Beautiful color!!!",

And this is one of the absolute best top coats out there, at any price. The only way to get a better one, in my opinion, is if you use a UV gel, and who wants to spend nearly 20 minutes soaking in pure acetone in order to remove a UV gel?
I find that this polish and topcoat removes quickly with acetone, and less quickly with a non acetone polish remover.
The top coat also makes any little streaks or flaws in the polish disappear.",

A sharp choice for Christmas, Fourth of July, or even Valentine's Day. Creamy, opaque, quick drying and long wearing.  Just a great one.

All Essie's are great.  I wear them almost exclusively as they are almost the only thing that wears above a day on my crazy nails.  I can typically get about a week with any Essie (and I can go beyond that with their gel couture).  I do reapply top coat every 2nd or third day.

The Gel Couture polishes are a thicker more gelly like formula than the ""regular"" Essies.  They I also have a wider brush, but it's so nicely tapered that it's easy to work with.  I would recommend the ""Regular"" Essies if you want to do nail art, but for regular one-color wear, either formula is nice.  The Gel Couture line does wear a little longer, but I'm typically ready to change colors before I reach their maximum wear time.

One of my favorite aspects of Essie is that its very forgiving if you happen to be prone to messing up your nails.  They dry quickly once the top coat is on (the color is a little more vulnerable to marring before the  top coat is applied), and as they dry they self-level to give you a smooth glassy surface even if your technique (like mine) is imperfect.

The Gel Couture line really requires the matching top coat to get its wear time, but I use that top coat over other Essies quite often as well.

My Essie collection is approaching 100 bottles and my obsession shows no signs of abating.  I did receive this bottle free to review, however I routinely purchase these polishes with my own money.  This is one of several reds I own, and it's one of my favorites.",

So, I waited for my favorite tv show to come on (so I wouldn't be tempted to walk around while waiting for my toes to dry) and began. In total, this is a three step process: apply a coat of color and wait, apply a second coat of color and wait, and finally apply the gel coat and wait. If you take your time, the end product is lovely! Nice color and super shiny!

Now, I know you might be tempted to use a heavier layer of color and then a heavier layer of color for a super rich look. Avoid this. By following the directions and using two regular coats, you are going to get a less streaky and more uniform color. Trust me, if you go a little heavy, it's going to take longer to dry and look clumpy. So, by going the easy route, the product is going to look its best. So, win-win!

They are also supposed to provide the longevity of a gel manicure, without the need for a curing light or the difficult removal process.  The color I received, Beau-Tie, is a pretty deep purple creme.  It looks quite blue-leaning in the bottle, but is actually much warmer on the nail.  In any case, the color was pretty, and the polish did look nice on my nails.  The instructions say to use the polish on bare nails (no base coat), do two coats, and follow with a coat of topper.  I did this, and I did have a nice, shiny manicure.  The shine was obvious, but I'm not convinced that it's anything exclusive to Essie.  There are other topcoats that will give you a similar appearance.  This polish definitely did not last the two weeks that the package claimed it would.  I found it lasted for about as long as any other polish when worn with a good topcoat- about four days.  The bigger issue, for me, is that without a base coat, my nails were in rough shape when this polish started chipping and I removed it.  They've been weak, peeling, and splitting.  The result is that I won't be wearing this without base coat again.  The bigger takeaway is that I don't find this to be fundamentally different from other nail polishes.  The ""gel couture"" business seems like a gimmick.  Also, I'm accustomed to using a quick dry topcoat, and this one takes much longer.  Be advised!",
5085,5,False,2017-08-14,A2CZ98V784SRJ0,B01E7UKR38,L. Perry,"I **LOVE** my Essies.  They are by far my favorite nail polish brand (and one of only two brands I will buy--only others are impossible on my nails).  Even though I have less-than-stellar technique and I am admittedly horribly hard on my nails, with Essie I can keep my nails looking professionally manicured without chips, redos, or drama. I am loyal to this brand for a reason!

WEAR TIME:  I'm fairly new to the Gel Couture line, though I've worn the classic Essie polishes for much longer.  I wondered how these would compare to my regular Essie routing (which is, Grow Stronger base coat, 2 coats of color, followed by Good to Go top coat), and I was astounded to find they compare very, very favorably.  I swear by Essie base coat, but was impressed that Gel Couture performed equally well with and without it.  (I do still like using it for a treatment layer and to prevent nail discoloration overtime; with Gel Couture I noticed no difference in wear time with or without base coat, though base coat  is a game changer with the classic Essies).  With my classic Essie colors, I tend to get about a week of wear, but do reapply top coat intermittently during the week (my goal is always every other day, but I usually forget pretty often).  In testing these out, I resisted reapplying top coat AT ALL, so that I could get a sense of how they wore on one application.  I'm quite impressed.  I got 11 days of wear, with a small few chips coming of the 11th or 12th day (depending on the shade).  I'm more than satisfied with that, given that I'm ridiculously hard on my nails and don't own a dishwasher.  Also, aside from Essie, I've found (at any price point) that there's only one other brand that doesn't chip within 24 hours (I can usually get 4 or 5 days with Revlon, so it's my second choice).  I went from a week with ""regular"" Essie to almost TWO weeks with these.  These last well past the point where I want to change my polish colors.

COLOR APPLICATION:  I've tried 7 of these Gala Bolds (as well as some from the original release and all but two of the Ballet Nudes), and I would say that with the exception of ONE shade, all of these polishes are dreamy to work with.  These are slightly thicker, more jelly like consistency than the classic Essies.  They are smooth and self leveling, apply like butter and look as smooth as satin.  The drip-free brush has a fabulous contour, so even working on my small nails, the wider brush was not an issue.  Most shades were opaque in one coat (but I'm a two coat girl, so I went for two anyway).  As Essie herself says, they ""Go on like silk and wear like Iron.""  The one color with a less stellar experience was ""Wearing Hue"" and if you sort Amazon reviews by color (yup, that's possible) you'll notice that most of the few negative reviews relate to that shade.  It's not an impossible shade, and milky opaque pastel colors are the more ""struggle-some"" colors in any range.  However, I did need a third coat to get to opaque and needed be more careful about not overflowing the nail bed. It still self leveled and wore beautifully.  I'd give this one shade 4 stars, but the others deserve more than 5.

(And anytime you are working with Essie, be patient with your perceived mistakes; give them a moment, they will self level and look as smooth as a calm sea even if you thought your application wasn't perfect.  They may be magic.)

TOP COAT:  I've taken to using this top coat with regular Essies instead of my Good to Go top coat.  There's magic in this bottle. Instead of getting 6-7 days with classic Essies, I can get more (though, I rarely want to, as I like to change my nail colors.)  With this top coat on Gel Couture, I am seeing 11 days!  Also, though I reapplied the Good to Go throughout the week, I don't feel the need to reapply with this one.  The Good to Go MIGHT stay a little (tiny bit) shinier through the week, but that's a hard call.  Though both wear well, this is my favorite.  Both dry super fast.  Like, ridiculously fast.  (I am currently testing the Gel Setter one, so I can't compare it yet.)  You do need to use this top coat with the Gel Couture polishes (or they won't last), however it's nice that it will work with traditional Essies as well.

I called Essie about this Platinum Gel Couture Top Coat, since I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be an improvement on the Gel Couture Top Coat (which is what it was called in the initial release of this line).  Essie has FABULOUS customer service, and they were able to confirm that it was a rebranding, and Gel Couture Top Coat and Platinum Gel Couture Top Coat are the same thing, just slightly rebranded.  (Not to be confused with the Gel Setter top coat, which IS different, and is NOT the one to use with this line.)

I can never recommend Essie enough.  They changed my nail game.  When I was almost ready to give up because fixing my nails took soooo long to do and to dry and I was getting so frustrated with fixing my mistakes, I discovered Essie.  They are MAGIC, I tell you.  They dry to a pro finish in spite of weak skills, and before I have a chance to screw them up.  And they stay on my impossible nails.  There's nothing remotely as good.  Love these!!!!",

This one is a lovely slightly violet polish in the red range. It's perfect for people like me who wear a lot of cool colors and have blue based coloring. The color in the bottle looks exactly like one in the photo on my screen, and slightly more red when it dried on my nails. I like it a lot. This color glides on very easily and almost covers in one coat. I did have to use a second coat to completely cover all the little spots that I missed the first time around. The polish looks good on its own, but the gel topcoat really sets it off. It gives my nails a hard, very shiny finish and helps to protect the manicure. It also smoothes out any imperfections that may have occurred when applying the first two coats. Don't skip it! The topcoat can also be worn on its own over bare nails for a nice shiny, finished look. But with so many beautiful Essie colors, why would you want to?

This polish was still going strong with only a hint of wear on the tip of one nail after 7 days. The top coat was still extremely shiny. My nails show growth at the base of the nail, so I usually change polish after 7 days. But if not for that, I probably could have gotten another couple days out of this polish. Great product!",

""Inside Scoop"" is a tea rose pink with a slight blue undertone. The color goes on streak free and doesn't require a basecoat.  I am able to get consistent, non-streak opaque color with one application - second application not needed but does seem to prolong the wear.  The top coat provides protection and shine.  It creates a hard shell which prevents chipping and has a high gloss.

I find this easy to remove and it lasts about 6 days with 2 color coats and one top coat.  I let it dry 3-5 minutes between each color coat and 10 minutes after the top coat.  The results look like what you'd get from a nail salon and lasts the whole week.  The shape of the brush allows for precise application.

First of all, I hate it when you get a cream polish and it takes three or four coats in order to get it to look opaque. There was so much pigmentation in this nail polish that I could have gotten by with just one coat, although I put on two. The photograph shows the two coats on my hand.
After doing one hand, the polish started to thicken up a little on my second hand. I've noticed that this often happens with quick dry formulas. No problem, I just wait a minute and then reshake the bottle.
If you don't do that, it can come out thick, which makes it a little streaky or textured. Even if that's the case, all of those imperfections disappear when you apply this magical top coat. No, I'm not exaggerating. It really is Magic.
It evens the color and gives you a perfect shine that lasts for days and days.

And here is the part that I want to shout out... If all of the above weren't enough to make you really love this stuff, hold on because there's more.
I have long complained that I don't like the Essie nail polish brushes. They're great if you have small and short nails, in my opinion, but not for me.
The brush has a perfect curve that matches the base of your nail, and it's wider so that with three strokes, middle side, and side, you are DONE. The brush holds just the right amount of polish.
This review is for the VIPlease color. I think of it as a hibiscus or raspberry shade.
It looks great when you're wearing blue, pink, and even certain shades of burgundy. It's absolutely stunning with tropical prints that include flowers and greenery.

While Essie states 'up to 14 days', one has to assess what effects those 14 days.

First off, this is an extremely pale opaque white with a hint of pink.

But the star of the kit, the best thing about it for sure, is the enclosed clock and brushing ""meter"".  What it does is keeps track of how long you brush, giving you four stars for 30 seconds on each mouth quadrant.  You can also get a fifth star (for tongue) if you go a total of 2 1/2 minutes.  For me, that's not a big deal.  But for my six year old, the stars have been a boon to getting him to brush more thoroughly.

He brushes with enthusiasm now, and I've noticed his teeth looking much cleaner than with just a brush alone.  For me, it's a helpful reminder to brush longer than I was used to.  The whole set is convenient, with a countertop charger and no batteries being required.  And having a clock in the bathroom was new to me, and very convenient.

However, two things keep me from giving it five stars.  One, the price point.  I wouldn't pay more than $50 for this set.  In all actuality, it doesn't seem worth the extremely high price point.  I mean, a Crest tote bag?  What am I going to do with that?  I don't think the set warrants the price.

The other minor point about this is you have to brush with your mouth tightly closed or you get watery toothpaste sprayed all over the mirror and counter.  Not to mention your face!  My son has to brush before he dresses or his school shirts get ruined.  So, it's a minor thing to get used to, but sort of annoying.

In all, a great set that would be better if it were more affordable.",

This mouthwash claims to help with inflammation and soreness of the gums. I'd say this claim is true. I wear braces and do get inflamed/sore gums from time to time. Crest Pro-Health For Life has helped with that. It actually soothes the gums. The inflammation goes away much quicker.

I used this in my WaterPik with great results as well. Normally, I fill it up half way with warm water and the rest of the way with Listerine. My orthodontist recommended this on account of the gaps I get from my braces, to clean good and disinfect the loose gum area and to help the irritation/inflammation. I feel like this Pro-Health does a better job in that area - it feels like it is soothing the sore spots and like I said, the inflammation, soreness and redness goes away much faster.

I did ask my orthodontist about using this mouthwash, if it would be beneficial to me in regards to the gum issues, since this product is meant for people over 50 years of age - I am only 36. He said it definitely could not hurt to try and would probably work well since it is made for gum issues. He told me to let him know how it goes. When I told him I believed it worked better and helped more, he told me to continue to use it. When he looked in my mouth in order to determine the adjustments for my braces during that visit, he mentioned to me that 2 particular areas look better than usual. The gum line at two specific teeth was always more red than any other area, even though it was never actually painful or swollen. Since I started using the Pro-Health, that redness has gone away.

To me, this product is very beneficial, while being gentle. There is no harsh alchohol taste, no nasty after taste. It is just simply a smooth mint flavor, just like the bottle says, that makes your mouth taste and feel fresh. In my case, it definitely did help with gum problems and for that reason I will continue to use it regularly.", 33.8 Ounce

5191,5,True,2017-09-28,A35QTJ23YREVYX,B00IJHY54S,G.I.M.,"I read that sponges need to be changed once a month... This product combines a body wash and sponge in one! The skin feels so clean each time I used it! And the sponge gives a gentle scrubbing sensation. To prolong its life, I first wash my hair (my body gets wet) turn off the water and scrub/soap-up my whole body with the Spongelle. Once done, I simply rinse off with the shower. This helps reduce water waste and prolong Spongelle's useful life-span. About a month and a half after first use, I start adding some of my favorite body wash. And after three months I replace it with a new one.",

5228,5,True,2016-11-18,AY8XPOPF0OVO5,B00RZYW4RG,ParadiseValley,This product works very well for me. I have tried so many things for straightening my hair. I use various creams and lotions while my hair is wet but I use this after I blowdry and before I flat iron.. My hair is curly (super curly at my scalp and very frizzy through the body of my hair). I have a lot of hair but it is thin and fine in texture. Before I flatiron I mist this all over my head. Be cautious not to overdo it or spray to close.  Even though looks like a big can of hairspray it is a spray shine that elimates frizz and makes your hair smooth and soft. 3 cans will last me an eternity but the price was great and a must have any time I straighten my hair,
5229,5,True,2016-10-11,AIG1G1AKH7JVB,B00RZYW4RG,Amazon Customer,Best stuff ever!  Makes my hair less frizzy when using with a flat iron.  Makes it soft & silky.  Highly recommend!,
